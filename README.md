# VisuaLife
> Seeing the World Through Sound.

A final year computer engineering project to build a wearable assistive device for the visually impaired. The core is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from first principles without external ML libraries.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Phase 1: Core Engine Development** (In Progress)

### âœ… Completed Components
- **Core Mathematical Engine**
  - Matrix multiplication with nested loops
  - Element-wise operations
  - Array summation along axes

- **Neural Network Layers**
  - Dense (Fully Connected) layer with forward/backward propagation
  - He initialization for stable training

- **Advanced Activation Functions**
  - ReLU, LeakyReLU, ParametricReLU
  - ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)
  - Swish (x * sigmoid(x))
  - Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax

- **Loss Functions**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression
  - Binary Cross Entropy for binary classification
  - Categorical Cross Entropy for multi-class classification
